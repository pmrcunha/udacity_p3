FROGGER Arcade Game
===============================

This simple arcade game was developed as a project from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. All the assets and the game engine were provided by them. I wrote the game logic and objects, doing minor changes to the material provided.

	3. When you reach the water you gain points and return to the start position
	4. When you hit a bug you lose one life and return to the start position
	5. The game is over when you have no lives left.
	6. You can collect bonuses to increase your score:
